CryptoID â€“ A Powerful Advanced Hash Identifier Tool
CryptoID is a versatile and easy-to-use Python tool designed to identify, encode, and decode various cryptographic hashes. Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, a pen tester, or a developer, CryptoID helps you easily identify hashes from a wide range of algorithms and even suggests the appropriate cracking tools.

Features:
Identify Hashes: Identify and match input hashes to their respective algorithms.
Encode Strings to Hashes: Hash strings using popular algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt, NTLM, and more.
Decode Hashes: Decode base64 or hex-encoded hashes.
Advanced Hash Analysis: Calculate entropy to measure the randomness of a hash.
Tool Suggestions: Suggests tools for cracking specific hashes based on their algorithm type.
Supported Hash Algorithms:
MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-3
